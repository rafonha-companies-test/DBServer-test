# DBServer-test - Front-end developer

This is a test to a Front-end developer job. I planned to use the following technologies:

- HTML5, CSS3 and VanillaJS are the basis of this project; 
- Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) - I'll use it to facilitate the HTML to do a responsive design;
- Jest (https://jestjs.io/) - I'll use it to test all the elements (unit test using mock).

## Highlights of my logic/code writing style
### 1) MVC model
I tried to use the MVC pattern to organize my code. Nevertheless, since this test is only about the logic of the program, it was not completed. 

### 2) Testing with Jest
I used Jest to do the testing of my code. I specially used the mock attribute to make it easier to test my application.

### 3) Best practices
I tried to follow all the best practices to make the code simple, clean and easy to understand.

## What could have been done in a better way


## FAQ
### 1) Why did you create an HTML?
I wanted to be able to see the application as a user, so I prefered to do a simple HTML to do so.

### 2) Why did you choose to use Jest?
I'm familiar with this library, so I thought I'd be easier to me to do the testing with it.

### 3) Why is your application so simple?
I wasn't confident about what I was suppose to do, so I did what I thought it was requested. Perhaps, if I had had a better understanding, I would have done it in a more sophisticated way.
