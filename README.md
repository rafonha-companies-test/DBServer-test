# DBServer-test - Front-end developer

This is a test to a Front-end developer job. I planned to use the following technologies:

- HTML5, CSS3 and VanillaJS are the basis of this project; 
- Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) - I'll use it to facilitate the HTML to do a responsive design;
- Jest (https://jestjs.io/) - I'll use it to test all the elements (unit test using mock).
