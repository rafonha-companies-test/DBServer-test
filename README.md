# DBServer-test - Front-end developer

This is a test to a Front-end developer job. I planned to use the following technologies:

- VanillaJS is the basis of this project; 
- HTML and CSS only to see the code in action.

I intended to create a simple alert code, simulating the temperatures outside the truck and inside each beer container. Every time the HTML is reloaded, the temperature changes (simulating opening the truck, for example), and a new alert appears.


## Highlights of my logic/code writing style
### 1) Testing
My intention was to make sure that my code works, so I used try/catch in every possible matter to secure that.

### 2) User experience
I wanted to be able to see the application as a user, so I did a simple HTML to see the logic in action.

### 3) Best practices
I tried to follow all the best practices to make the code simple, clean and easy to understand. 

### 4) Commenting the code
I hope the code is well commented, so there is no doubt about its uses.

## What could have been done in a better way
### 1) MVC model
I tried to use the MVC pattern to organize my code. Nevertheless, since this test is only about the logic of the program, it was not completed. Also, because of some technical issues, I couldn't divide de code property, which was a pity.

### 2) Testing with Jest
I wanted to use Jest to do the testing of my code, since I think it'd be great for unit testing and mocking results.

### 3) Responsive design with Bootstrap
I would like to finish the HTML with some styling to see what it could be in real life.


## FAQ
### 1) How does the code work?
Simply load the HTML page to see the local temperature (outside the truck) and the temperatures on each beer container. If there's a container with a higher or lower temperature than prescribed, an alert is shown to the user. The local temperature can randomly vary between 10 and 40 degrees celsius, and it influences the temperature in each beer container. 

### 2) Why did you create a simple HTML?
I wanted to be able to see the application as a user, so I prefered to do a simple HTML to do so. It wasn't my main focus, that's why it's so simple.

### 3) Why is your application so simple?
I wasn't confident about what I was suppose to do, so I did what I thought it was requested. Perhaps, if I had had a better understanding, I would have done it in a more sophisticated way. 


## Notes
Whatever happens, I'm glad I tried!

I had some difficulties with the modularization of the code, so, instead of dividind the code in small javascrip files - which would be better for organization and reuse of the code -, I had to put everything together in a single javascript file.
