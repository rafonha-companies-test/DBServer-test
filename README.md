# DBServer-test - Front-end developer

This is a test to a Front-end developer job. I planned to use the following technologies:

- HTML5, CSS3 and VanillaJS are the basis of this project; 
- Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) - I'll use it to facilitate the HTML to do a responsive design;


## Highlights of my logic/code writing style
### 1) Testing
My intention was to make sure that my code works, so I used try/catch in every possible matter to secure that.

### 2) User experience
I wanted to be able to see the application as a user, so I did a simple HTML to see the logic in action.

### 3) Best practices
I tried to follow all the best practices to make the code simple, clean and easy to understand.


## What could have been done in a better way
### 1) MVC model
I tried to use the MVC pattern to organize my code. Nevertheless, since this test is only about the logic of the program, it was not completed. 

### 2) Testing with Jest
I wanted to use Jest to do the testing of my code, since I think it'd be great for unit testing and mocking results.


## FAQ
### 1) Why did you create a simple HTML?
I wanted to be able to see the application as a user, so I prefered to do a simple HTML to do so. It wasn't my main focus, that's why it's so simple.

### 2) Why is your application so simple?
I wasn't confident about what I was suppose to do, so I did what I thought it was requested. Perhaps, if I had had a better understanding, I would have done it in a more sophisticated way. 


## Notes
Whatever happens, I'm glad I tried!
